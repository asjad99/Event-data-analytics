Process analytic approaches allow organizations to support the practice of Business Process Management and continuous improvement by leveraging all process-related data to  identifying performance bottlenecks, reducing costs, extracting insights and optimizing the utilization of available resources. In order to develop process analytic capabilities for, it is crucial to collect relevant data in a manner which captures for each executed process instance, the ordering of activities (events), associated resources and their outcomes. We can also view this past process execution data as representing either positive (value-adding) outcomes or negative (non-optimal)  outcomes. This  Process execution data once collected will contain hidden insights and actionable knowledge that are of considerable business value. Given process logs as input, the process analytic machinery can be developed by which will generate predictive (what is the likely outcome?), prescriptive (what should be done next?) and diagnostic (why did things turn out the way they did?) insights to support (and provide an evidence base for) farming decisions.
