### EMD techniques

*Trend is an intrinsically fitted monotonic function or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within a given data span.*

EMD techniques that are well suited for non-stationary and non-linear processes without replying on extrinsic functional or simplifying assumption. 

#### Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD):

when dealing with nonlinear and non-stationary time series, neither the standard Fourier transform1 nor the wavelet Transform represent the best approach. In fact, all of them produce linear decompositions, whereas real life data sets are in many cases generated by nonlinear phenomena. Furthermore, all the aforementioned methods have troubles providing an accurate time-frequency representation of the data2 due to the well known Heisenberg uncertainty principle

This paper  https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0701020104  recommends using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for Determining Intrinsic Trend for non linear and nonstationary time series. This method allows us to decompose the time series to obtain components which help you analyze / understand data inherent features. This method is aimed at the decomposition of nonstationary and nonlinear signals in order to unravel their hidden quasi-periodicity and features. 

The signal is divided into several simple components via the so called sifting approach, which boils down to the calculation of the signal moving average via envelopes connecting its extrema. Then, each component is analysed separately in the time-frequency domain

This paper which discusses best practices around the use of EMD: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72193-2  
encourages the use of newer variants of the methods that overcomes some of the shortcomings of the original method.

#### Best Practices: 

more suitable than traditional methods for the analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary signals, they could be easily misused if their known limitations, together with the assumptions they rely on, are not carefully considered. 

This paper has outlined the best practices around the use of EMD techniques https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72193-2 

They strongly discourage the usage of original EMD method and discuss several other pitfalls. 

Several newly developed methods are based on EMD, they all address the so called mode mixing problem and guarantee the stability of the decomposition with respect to noise.
