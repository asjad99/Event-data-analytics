Background:
Anomalies are often divided into point and pattern anomalies. Point anomalies are single instances of something abnormal, while 
pattern anomalies represent clusters of data that are abnormal.
Pattern anomalies are more difficult to detect because we must first be able to define a normal pattern, and then we 
could need more data to be able to classify that this pattern is anomalous compared to historical activity.

Point anomalies:

Given a sequence of real values, i.e., x = x1, x2, ..., xn, the task of time-series anomaly detection is to produce an output
sequence, y = y1,y2, ...,yn, where yi âˆˆ {0, 1} denotes whether xi is an anomaly point.

PATTERN ANOMALIES

Our aim here is to detect a continuous set of data points that are collectively anomalous even though the individual points 
may or may not be point anomalies. When we are looking for pattern anomalies 
the underlying assumption is that the raw data must show a pattern.
